{"name":"Modation","tagline":"Soundation, amplified.","body":"## Quick Install\r\nDownload from the Chrome Webstore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modation/mceoomlpmmmghcdfammgcjnhdnnambef\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\nModation is an extension for Google's Chrome web browser that extends community functionality for [**Soundation**](http://soundation.com), an online collaborative music studio. This extension adds a button to the Chrome toolbar for easy access to all notifications on your Soundation account. When you receive a new message or group invitation, a number will appear on the added toolbar button, and a desktop notification will appear on your screen.\r\n\r\n## Why do I need it?\r\nThe Soundation Community is a tremendous feature, and one of the best parts of the site. One thing it lacks is a truly practical notifications system. The site will display a summary of new messages, follows, invitations, and memberships, but these are visible only within the site. Modation has the ability to pull these updates on a regular basis and instantly alert you of changes.\r\n\r\nModation also boasts several community enhancements, called **Dynamics**. The **Watchlist** can track changes on tracks and groups, producing notifications when these occur. **Profile** and **Group Tips** generate tooltips with summaries of user profiles and group information on their respective links throughout the site. **Smart Player** will automatically pause a currently playing track if another is started. Various other mods and features are available, with more to come in the near future.\r\n\r\n## What about privacy?\r\nThis extension knows who you are on Soundation. **Thatâ€™s it.** In no way does it track, store, record, upload, or save any personally identifiable information about your use, nor will it ever in the foreseeable future. The only tracking that may occur would be performed by Google itself, and is detailed in their [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). I want to respect the privacy of all users, so the usage of this extension is anonymous and will stay that way.\r\n\r\n## I'm requesting a feature/enhancement/bugfix/etc.\r\nAdd an [issue](https://github.com/cyberbit/modation/issues) with your request details. I will do my best to respond to each issue in a timely fasion. Realize also that Modation is still in beta, so bugs exist and are not hard to find!\r\n\r\n## What about xyz?\r\nIf anything is unclear, or you have a question not addressed here, please [contact](https://github.com/cyberbit) me.\r\n\r\n## Release History\r\nEverything since v0.5.1 is under [Releases](https://github.com/cyberbit/modation/releases). Anything older is archived on the dedicated Soundation group  [here](http://soundation.com/group/modation).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
